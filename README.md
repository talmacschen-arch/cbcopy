# cbcopy

cbcopy is an efficient database migration tool designed to transfer data and metadata from Greenplum Database(GPDB) to Apache Cloudberry(Cloudberrydb), while also supporting migrations between Greenplum databases and between Cloudberry databases for disaster recovery and database version upgrades.

## How does cbcopy work?

### Metadata migration
The metadata migration feature of cbcopy is based on [gpbackup](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpbackup-archive). Compared to GPDB's built-in `pg_dump`, cbcopy's main advantage is its ability to retrieve metadata in batches. While `pg_dump` fetches metadata one row or a few rows at a time, cbcopy retrieves it in batches. This batch processing approach significantly enhances performance, especially when handling large volumes of metadata, making it much faster than `pg_dump`.

### Data migration
Both GPDB and CBDB support starting programs via SQL commands, and cbcopy utilizes this feature. During data migration, it uses SQL commands to start a program on the destination database to receive and load data, while simultaneously using SQL commands to start a program on the source database to unload data and send it to the program on the destination database.

## Pre-Requisites

The project requires the Go Programming language version 1.19 or higher. Follow the directions [here](https://golang.org/doc/) for installation, usage and configuration instructions.

## Downloading

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HashDataInc/cbcopy.git
```

## Building and installing binaries
Switch your current working directory to the above `cbcopy` source directory

**Build**

```bash
make
```
This will build the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper binaries in the source directory.

**Install**

```bash
make install
```
This will install the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper programs binaries the `$GPHOME/bin` directory. Note that GPDB must be sourced for this to work.

## Test
### Test setup
Some integration tests depend on the `dummy_seclabel` extension in the Database. Therefore, you need to install the `dummy_seclabel` extension in the Database first. This extension exists only to support testing of the SECURITY LABEL statement and is not intended for use in production. After successfully installing the `dummy_seclabel` extension, use the following commands to enable it.

```bash
# Configure the shared_preload_libraries parameter to include the dummy_seclabel extension
gpconfig -c shared_preload_libraries -v dummy_seclabel

# Restart the Greenplum database to apply the changes
gpstop -ra

# Verify that the dummy_seclabel extension has been successfully added to shared_preload_libraries
gpconfig -s shared_preload_libraries | grep dummy_seclabel
```

### Running tests
To run all tests except end-to-end (unit, and integration), use:
```bash
make test
```

To run only unit tests, use:
```bash
make unit
```

Running integration tests requires a database instance with the gpcloud extension installed, and the database must be configured with the `--with-perl` option:
```bash
make integration
```

To run end to end tests (requires a running GPDB instance), use:
```bash
make end_to_end
```

## Code Style

We use `goimports` to maintain consistent code formatting. Before submitting any changes, please run:
```bash
make format
```

This will:
- Format all Go files according to Go standard formatting rules
- Organize imports into groups (standard library, external packages, internal packages)
- Remove any unused imports
- Ensure consistent code style across the project

## Migrating Data with cbcopy

Before migrating data, you need to copy cbcopy_helper to the `$GPHOME/bin` directory on all nodes of both the source and destination databases. Then you need to find a host that can connect to both the source database and the destination database, and use the cbcopy command on that host to initiate the migration. Note that database superuser privileges are required for both source and destination databases to perform the migration.

By default, both metadata and data are migrated. You can use `--metadata-only` to migrate only metadata, or `--data-only` to migrate only data. Based on our best practices, we recommend migrating metadata first using `--metadata-only`, and then migrating data using `--data-only`. This two-step approach helps ensure a more controlled and reliable migration process.

### Database version requirements
cbcopy relies on the "COPY ON SEGMENT" command of the database, so it has specific version requirements for the database.

- `GPDB 4.x` - A minimum of GPDB version 4.3.17 or higher is required. If your version does not meet this requirement, you can upgrade to GPDB 4.3.17.
- `GPDB 5.x` - A minimum of GPDB version 5.1.0 or higher is required. If your version does not meet this requirement, you can upgrade to GPDB 5.1.0.
- `GPDB 6.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 6.x.
- `GPDB 7.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 7.x.
- `CBDB 1.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of CBDB 1.x.

### ⚠️ Important: Common Issues

#### Hostname Resolution

**Common Issue**: Many users encounter connection failures when using hostname for `--dest-host` because the hostname cannot be resolved from the source cluster nodes.

**Problem**: When you specify a hostname (e.g., `--dest-host=dest-warehouse-cluster`) instead of an IP address, all nodes in the source cluster must be able to resolve this hostname to the correct IP address. If the hostname resolution fails on any source cluster node, the migration will fail with errors such as `could not write to copy program: Broken pipe` which can be triggered by network issues.

The symmetric constraint applies under `--connection-mode=pull`: the value of `--source-host` must be reachable from the destination cluster nodes, since under pull mode it is the destination that initiates the data connection back to the source. Passing a loopback address like `127.0.0.1` for `--source-host` works only when cbcopy is invoked from a node that the destination cluster also sees as itself; for any real cross-cluster setup the source address must be one the destination can dial.

#### `cbcopy_helper` Not Deployed

**Common Issue**: A common oversight is forgetting to copy the `cbcopy_helper` binary to all nodes in both the source and destination clusters. This can lead to connection errors that may appear to be DNS or network-related issues.

**Problem**: The `cbcopy` utility relies on the `cbcopy_helper` executable being present on every node of both the source and destination clusters to facilitate data transfer. If the helper is missing on any node, `cbcopy` may fail with error messages, such as being unable to resolve hostnames or establish connections, because the necessary communication channel cannot be opened.

#### Segment-to-Segment Network Connectivity

**Common Issue**: The masters of the source and destination clusters can communicate via TCP, but the segments cannot connect to each other due to firewall restrictions.

**Problem**: If you don't configure your firewall to allow TCP connections between segments of both clusters, you will likely encounter a situation where some tables (with small data volumes) migrate successfully while others (with large data volumes) fail.

This happens because small tables are typically processed by the masters (copy on master), while large tables are distributed across segments for parallel processing (copy on segment). When segments cannot reach each other, the migration fails with the same error messages as network issues: `could not write to copy program: Broken pipe`. This mixed success/failure pattern is a strong indicator of segment-to-segment connectivity problems.

#### Manual Query Cancellation

If you manually cancel a running migration query (e.g., terminating the `COPY` command via `pg_cancel_backend` or similar), the `cbcopy_helper` process will be forced to exit. This typically leads to the following error signatures:

- **Target Database Errors:** `extra data after last expected column` or `missing data for column xxx`.
  - *Reason:* The Query Executor (QE) process reads incomplete or partial rows remaining in the pipe after the helper exits abruptly.
- **Source Database Errors:** `could not write to copy program: Broken pipe`.
  - *Reason:* The target-side `cbcopy_helper` closed the connection, breaking the pipe.

These errors are expected side effects of a forced cancellation and indicate that the data transfer was interrupted mid-stream, rather than a data corruption issue.

### Connection Modes

cbcopy supports two connection modes to handle different network environments:

- `--connection-mode=push` (default) - Source cluster connects to destination cluster. The destination cluster listens for incoming connections from the source cluster.
- `--connection-mode=pull` - Destination cluster connects to source cluster. The source cluster listens for incoming connections from the destination cluster.

#### When to use Pull Mode

The **pull mode** is particularly useful when the destination cluster is running inside Kubernetes (K8s) or other containerized environments where:

- The destination cluster cannot expose external ports for incoming connections
- Network policies restrict inbound traffic to the destination cluster  
- The source cluster is external to the K8s cluster and cannot reach internal services

In pull mode, the destination cluster (running inside K8s) initiates connections to the source cluster (external), bypassing network connectivity restrictions common in containerized environments.

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Push mode (default) - source connects to destination
cbcopy --source-host=external-db --dest-host=dest-warehouse \
    --connection-mode=push ...

# Pull mode - destination connects to source (recommended for K8s scenarios)
cbcopy --source-host=external-db --dest-host=k8s-warehouse-cluster \
    --connection-mode=pull ...
```

### Migration Modes

cbcopy supports seven migration modes.

- `--full` - Migrate all metadata and data from the source database to the destination database.
- `--dbname` - Migrate a specific database or multiple databases from the source to the destination database.
- `--schema` - Migrate a specific schema or multiple schemas from the source database to the destination database.
-  `--schema-mapping-file` - Migrate specific schemas specified in a file from the source database to the destination database.
- `--include-table` - Migrate specific tables or multiple tables from the source database to the destination database.
- `--include-table-file` - Migrate specific tables specified in a file from the source database to the destination database.
- `--global-metadata-only` - Migrate global objects from the source database to the destination database.

### Data Loading Modes
cbcopy supports three data loading modes; exactly one must be specified
(except in `--metadata-only` / `--global-metadata-only` mode):

- `--append` - Insert the migrated records into the table directly, regardless of the existing records.
- `--truncate` - First, clear the existing records in the table, and then insert the migrated records into the table.
- `--skip-existing` - Skip copying a table from the source database if a table with the same fully qualified name already exists in the destination database. Aligned with gpcopy's option of the same name. The existence check is by FQN only; column definitions are not compared. For partitioned tables the check is by root-table FQN, so the entire partition tree is skipped when the root exists.

### Object dependencies

If the tables you are migrating depend on certain global objects (such as tablespaces), there are two ways to handle this:

1. Include the `--with-global-metadata` option (default: false) during migration, which will automatically create these global objects in the destination database.

2. If you choose not to use `--with-global-metadata`, you must manually create these global objects in the destination database before running the migration. For example:
   ```sql
   -- If your tables use custom tablespaces, create them first:
   CREATE TABLESPACE custom_tablespace LOCATION '/path/to/tablespace';
   ```

If neither option is taken, the creation of dependent tables in the destination database will fail with errors like "tablespace 'custom_tablespace' does not exist".

### Role
If you want to change the ownership of the tables during migration without creating identical roles in the destination database (by disabling the `--with-global-metadata` option), you need to:

1. First create the target roles in the destination database
2. Use the `--owner-mapping-file` to specify the mapping between source and target roles

For example, if you have a mapping file with:
```
source_role1,target_role1
source_role2,target_role2
```

The migration process will execute statements like:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO target_role1;
```

If the target role doesn't exist in the destination database, these ownership change statements will fail with an error like "role 'target_role1' does not exist".

### Tablespace
cbcopy provides three ways to handle tablespace migration:

1. **Default Mode** - When no tablespace options are specified, objects will be created in the same tablespace names as they were in the source database. You have two options to ensure the tablespaces exist in the destination database:
   - Use `--with-global-metadata` to automatically create matching tablespaces
   - Manually create the tablespaces in the destination database before migration:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLESPACE custom_space LOCATION '/path/to/tablespace';
     ```

2. **Single destination Tablespace** (`--dest-tablespace`) - Migrate all source database objects into a single specified tablespace on the destination database, regardless of their original tablespace locations. For example:
   ```bash
   cbcopy --dest-tablespace=new_space ...
   ```

3. **Tablespace Mapping** (`--tablespace-mapping-file`) - Map source tablespaces to different target tablespaces using a mapping file. This is useful when you want to maintain separate tablespaces or map them to different locations. The mapping file format is:
   ```
   source_tablespace1,target_tablespace1
   source_tablespace2,target_tablespace2
   ```

Note: 
- For the default mode, either use `--with-global-metadata` or ensure all required tablespaces exist in the destination database before migration
- If you need to migrate objects from different schemas into different tablespaces, you can either:
  1. Use `--tablespace-mapping-file` to specify all mappings at once
  2. Migrate one schema at a time using `--dest-tablespace` with different target tablespaces

### Parallel Jobs

- `--copy-jobs` - The maximum number of tables that concurrently copies.

### Validate Migration
During migration, we will compare the number of rows returned by `COPY TO` from the source database (i.e., the number of records coming out of the source database) with the number of rows returned by `COPY FROM` in the destination database (i.e., the number of records loaded in the destination database). If the two counts do not match, the migration of that table will fail.

### Copy Strategies

cbcopy internally supports three copy strategies for tables.

- `Copy On Coordinator` - If the table's statistics `pg_class->reltuples` is less than `--on-segment-threshold`, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On Coordinator` strategy for this table, meaning that data migration between the source and destination databases can only occur through the coordinator node.
- `Copy On Segment` - If the table's statistics `pg_class->reltuples` is greater than `--on-segment-threshold`, and both the source and target databases have the same version and the same number of nodes, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On Segment` strategy for this table. This means that data migration between the source and destination databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes without data redistribution.
- `Copy on External Table` - For tables that do not meet the conditions for the above two strategies, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On External Table` strategy. This means that data migration between the source and destination databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes with data redistribution.

### Log Files and Migration Results

After cbcopy completes its execution, it generates several files in the `$USER/gpAdminLogs` directory:

1. **Log File**
   - `cbcopy_$timestamp.log` - Contains all execution logs, including:
     - Debug messages
     - Error messages
     - Operation details

2. **Migration Result Files**
   - `cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp` - Lists all successfully migrated tables
   - `cbcopy_failed_$timestamp` - Lists all tables that failed to migrate

These files are useful for:
- Monitoring the migration process
- Troubleshooting any issues
- Planning retry attempts for failed migrations

### Handling Failed Migrations

When a migration fails partially (some tables succeed while others fail), cbcopy generates two files:
- `cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp` - Lists all successfully migrated tables
- `cbcopy_failed_$timestamp` - Lists all tables that failed to migrate

For retry attempts, you can skip previously successful tables by using the success file:
```bash
cbcopy --exclude-table-file=cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp ...
```

This approach helps you:
- Save time by not re-migrating successful tables
- Reduce the risk of data inconsistency
- Focus only on resolving failed migrations

## Examples

### Basic Migration
```bash
# Migrate specific schemas
cbcopy --with-global-metadata --source-host=127.0.0.1 \
    --source-port=45432 --source-user=gpadmin \
    --dest-host=127.0.0.1 --dest-port=55432 \
    --dest-user=cbdb --schema=source_db.source_schema \
    --dest-schema=target_db.target_schema \
    --truncate
```
